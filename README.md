## Introduction

This repository showcases my work on two distinct Python scripts. Each script serves a unique purpose and highlights different aspects of my programming abilities.

## Project Descriptions

`main.py` is a Python script designed to decode the custom image format back to what it originally was. Here are some of its key features:

- Easy Decoding thanks to Binary
- Easy to Understand
- Beginner Friendly

`png2custom.py` is a Python script aimed at converting 'png' format to a Custom Format, which ofcourse can later be decoded and opened using `main.py`. Key functionalities include:

- Easy and Fast Conversion of PNG to a Custom Format
- Easy to Use

## Installation

To get started with these projects, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine ( Requires GIT to be installed) :

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/custom-python-projects.git
   
   cd custom-python-projects
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install any dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Here's how you can use each script:

### Running main.py

To run `main.py`, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py "image_location"
```

### Running png2custom.py

To run `png2custom.py`, use the following command:

```bash
python png2custom.py "png_image_location+name" "custom_image_location+name"
```

## Example

For Running `main.py` :
```bash
python main.py file.custom
```

For Running `png2custom.py` :
```bash
python png2custom.py file.png file.custom
```
